## About

This is demo on how to use 'through' for example, when we have third table holding relation id's for other 2 tables.

## Usage

Manually create database named 'demo_c' and run the 'migrate' and 'seed' commands from the package.json file.

Start the server with 'npm start' and test your queries with Postman.
